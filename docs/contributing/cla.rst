Contributor License Agreement
#############################

Before we can accept your contributions to VyOS, you must sign a **Contributor
License Agreement (CLA)**.

This is a standard open-source practice designed to protect both you and the
project.

The process is simple and fully automated:

1. **Review the CLA document**

   You can find the CLA text at our
   `GitHub repository <https://github.com/vyos/vyos-cla-signatures/>`__.

2. **Submit a pull request**

   When you open a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically check whether all
   commit authors have signed the CLA.

3. **Follow the bot's instructions**

   If the CLA has not been signed, the bot will leave a comment with a prompt.
   Simply reply to that comment with the suggested text to sign the CLA.

4. **Wait for confirmation**

   The CLA bot will verify your response and update the pull request status.
   Once all commit authors have signed, the bot will confirm that the CLA
   requirement has been met, and unlock the pull request for merging.

.. note::

   The CLA must be signed by **each commit author**.

   If your pull request includes commits from multiple contributors, each of
   them must sign the CLA before the pull request can be accepted.

Once signed, the CLA remains valid for all past and future contributions to VyOS
made under the same GitHub identity.
